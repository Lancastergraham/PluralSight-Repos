I can use getline(<Variable name>, <cin or filestream>) to get an entire string with spaces.

other wise 

cin >> word1 >> word2 

will take the first word till space

for example "Hello World"

word1 will be hello, word2 will be world.

but "Hello Beautiful world"

ENCAPSULATION
-A well written class is changeable.
-Make all your member variables private.
--Code outside the class cant count on their names or types
--You can change name, type without breaking code outside the class
--Code outside the class doesn't need to know the rules or remember them
---You can change the business rules later.
Must use cin.ignore to allow getline(xxx,xxx) to work later, because the getline will consume white space used earlier, like hitting enter from a previous cin >> statement.

-You can add a public member functions as gatekeepers
--eg getBalance() to find out an account's balance
--- never assume one getSomething() for ever member varialbe
--Dont always need a setSomething()
