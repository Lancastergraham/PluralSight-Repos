I can use getline(<Variable name>, <cin or filestream>) to get an entire string with spaces.

other wise 

cin >> word1 >> word2 

will take the first word till space

for example "Hello World"

word1 will be hello, word2 will be world.

but "Hello Beautiful world"


Must use cin.ignore to allow getline(xxx,xxx) to work later, because the getline will consume white space used earlier, like hitting enter from a previous cin >> statement.
